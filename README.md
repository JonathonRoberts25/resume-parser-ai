# Resume Parser AI

> A web application that uses the OpenAI API to parse resume PDF files and extract key information into a structured, easy-to-read table.

This project serves as a complete example of a full-stack application built with Node.js, Express, and modern JavaScript. It provides a simple user interface for uploading a resume, processes the file on the server, and leverages a powerful language model to intelligently structure the unstructured text data.

## ‚úÖ Features

-   **Simple Web Interface:** A clean, user-friendly HTML form for file uploads.
-   **PDF Text Extraction:** Securely processes PDF files on the server to extract raw text content.
-   **AI-Powered Parsing:** Sends the extracted text to the OpenAI API (using the `gpt-4o` model) with a detailed prompt to ensure accurate data structuring.
-   **Structured Table Output:** Dynamically displays the parsed information‚ÄîEducation, Employment/Projects, and Awards‚Äîin a clean, organized HTML table.
-   **Error Handling:** Provides clear feedback to the user if the file upload fails or if the API encounters an issue.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
-   An **OpenAI API Key** with billing set up. You can get one from the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/resume-parser-ai.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd resume-parser-ai
    ```

3.  **Install the necessary npm packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    -   Create a new file in the root of the project named `.env`
    -   Open the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key like this:

    ```sh
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-YourSecretApiKeyHere
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The server will start, and you will see a confirmation message in the terminal.

## üìñ Usage

1.  Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
    [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

2.  You will see the upload form. Click to select a resume in PDF format from your computer.

3.  Click the **"Parse Resume"** button.

4.  Wait a few moments for the server to process the file and for the OpenAI API to respond.

5.  The parsed data will appear in a structured table on the page.

## üîß Customization

The core of the AI's logic is the system prompt sent to the OpenAI API. You can easily modify this prompt to change the data you want to extract or the format you want it in.

The prompt is located in the `server.js` file inside the `/parse-resume` route, stored in the `systemPrompt` constant.
